            <h4 id='session2'>Session 2: March 5th, 2019</h4>
            <p>The party awakes the following morning to find Sildar sitting in self-reflection, tending a campfire
                which he
                uses to brew his morning coffee. The moment's peace is broken when the group takes up their debate from
                the
                previous night over where to head next. They eventually settle on pursuing the Goblins and helping
                Sildar
                investogate his missing friend.
                <br>
                <br>Upon arriving at the location of the previous nights encounter, Sildar performs the last rights on
                his
                fallen comrade while Denethor and Kag scout the woods for Goblin tracks. They find footprints leading
                to a worn
                path that leads uphill through the woods. The path comes to a clearing in the woods near the base of a
                cliff.
                They spot a cave opening in the cliff side from which a stream flows in their general direction.
                Attempt to get
                a closer inspection, Denethor alerts some Goblin lookouts hiding in the nearby woods. A battle ensues.
                <br>
                <br>Merle fires blindly into the woods and lands some lucky shots with his crossbow while the others
                charge
                into the woods, weapons drawn. They make quick work of the scouts, stopping one from escaping and
                alerting his
                friends.
                <br>
                <br>After the skirmish, the party sneaks into the cave and encounters a pack of wild dogs chained to a
                post
                driven in the floor. Hazard tosses a portion of his private stash of horse meat to the beasts, which
                seems to
                keep them appeased for the time being.
                <br>
                <br>Following the stream deeper into the cave, the party spots another Goblin lookout standing atop a
                bridge
                over the stream. In an attempt to flank the Goblin, Kag and Denethor try to climb up a pile of rubble
                near the
                bridge while Merle distracts the guard by conjuring an illusory floating sack of gold. The plan is
                unsuccessful. The goblin is alerted and calls out behind him, "Release the flood!"
                <br>
                <br> A moment passes before a huge wave of water rushes through the cave, sweeping Merle, Octavius and
                Hazard
                off their feet and out of the cave. Kag and Denethor climb to the top of the rubble and drop a rope
                down for
                their friends, who now must run back to their previous location while dodging Goblin arrows. Once
                everyone is
                safe atop the rubble pile, they hearing hideous laughing from a passage above them. They climb up to
                investigate and find 5 Goblins torturing a young dwarf. Sildar strikes first with his throwing knife,
                then
                chaos commences.
                <br>
                <br>After a bloody skirmish with the Goblins, Sildar approaches the badly beaten dwarf. They discover
                the dwarf
                is not Sildar's friend (who turns out to be Gundren Rockseeker, the party's employer), but a simple
                merchant
                captured on his way to Phandelin. When questioned, the dwarf reveals that he is not the only dwarf that
                has
                been held captive here, though he does not know any names, nor where they are located. He claims there
                are more
                Goblins on the Eastern portion of the cave.
                <br>
                <br>The party decides to rest and nurse their wounds before continuing onward.</p>

            <h4 id='session1'>Session 1: February 26th, 2019</h4>
            <p>Answering a flyer posted on a job board in Neverwinter, you meet a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker. He
                offers you 10gp to transport a wagon of supplies to Barthen's Provisions the nearby settlement of
                Phandalin. Gundren says he would normally do the job himself, but he has "an important family
                obligation that he must attend to immediately."
                <br>
                <br>The first two days of your journey are uneventful. You pass the time sharing stories with the other
                members of the crew hired for the job. They include:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>a wood elf druid named Denethor</li>
                    <li>a half-orc barbarian named Kag</li>
                    <li>a half-elf paladin named Octavius</li>
                    <li>a human cleric named Hazard</li>
                    <li>and a talking wolf warlock named Merle</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>As your party undertook the most dangerous stretch of the journey, the Triboar Trail, they spotted
                an overturned cart and two dead horses. Upon investigating, they were ambushed by a pack of Goblins.
                Who are dispatched in a most gruesome manner
                <br>
                <br>That night, Denethor keeps watch while the party rests. He hears yelling down the road and wakes
                Octavius and Merle to investigate. They find Sildar Hallwinter fending off a pack of Goblins and rush
                to his aid. The party captures a Goblin alive and takes him back to camp for questioning.
                <br>
                <br>Acting as an interpreter, Kag reveals that the Goblins were instructed to capture any dwarves they
                encounter on their regular raids of the trail and bring them to their hideout. Sildar seems dismayed at
                hearing this news. Upon questioning him, Sildar explains that he is looking for his friend, a dwarf,
                that has gone missing. Sildar resolves that he will head to the Goblin hideout at daybreak to
                investigate. After some heated discussion among the group, you decide the assist Sildar on his quest.
