            <h4 id='session5'>Session 5: March 26th, 2019 </h4>
            <p>
                Octavius disapprovingly surveys the mess this companions have created in his absence. He informs the
                party that some menacing goons are hastily approaching the tavern that happen to resemble the
                unfortunate fellows lying dead on the tavern floor below them. The party wisely agrees to retreat
                through the rear exit rather risk another conflict. Out back, they spot an iron fence separating the
                tavern's backyard from that of the neighboring chapel. Octavius hops the fence, startling a nun that is
                crouched down tending to the chapel's garden. He beacons his companions to take refuge in the chapel,
                ignoring the nun's willingness to provide sanctuary.
                <br>
                <br>
                Inside, she introduces herself as Sister Garaele, the keeper of the Chapel of Tymora. He informs the
                party that the Redbrands have taken control of the town, taking the old Tresendor Manor as their
                headquarters. Spotting a familiar pendant on Octavius' armor, Garaele inquires if he was a member of the
                Legio Gemina, stating that her brother, Ismaeli, once served in the outfit long, long ago in the old
                country. She informs Octavius that he has been in a state of severe depression since deserting the
                regiment, yet she in unable to help. She asks that if they should meet, perhaps Octavius could speak
                with him.
                <br>
                <br>
                After taking a short rest in the chapel, the party ventures forth toward the Lumber Mill where Ismaeli
                works. Though the town has quieted down since the fight, they spot a group of Redbrands interrogating
                citizens in the streets. The party arrives at the mill as the work day is coming to an end. The foreman
                introduces Octavius to Ismaeli, a gaunt half-elf with deep bags under his eyes. Ismaeli seems eager at
                first to talk to a veteran, but when Octavius asks about the "darkness" he's been experiencing, becomes
                nervous and cagey and makes a quick departure.
                <br>
                <br>
                Without much to guide them, the party decides to check in with their old friend Sildar at the Stonehill
                Inn. Upon entering, they find the inn to be much more refined and calm than the Sleeping Giant. Denethor
                treats himself to a glass of fine wine at the bar while Hazard asks the urbane elf tending bar if he's
                seen their friend. The barkeep informs them that Sildar was sitting at this very bar not 2 hours ago
                when the Redbrands burst into the inn and savagely excised him from the premises. The party decides its
                time to check out the manor.
                <br>
                <br>
                When they arrive at the manor's gates the find it in a state of disrepair; the windows show no lights
                within and the roof appears to be largely collapsed. Octavius notes the surprisingly steep incline of
                the hill while Merle invokes his otherwordly power of beast speech, calling a falcon to their aid. A
                falcon responds to the strange call in no time and Merle asks it if it is aware of another entrance to
                the manor. It says it does and leads them to a crevasse in the eastern side of the hill that leads to a
                narrow cave. Kag inspects the cave and finds a tripwire hidden behind some brush at the cave's entrance
                - obviously meant to stop intruders.
                <br>
                <br>
                After venturing a few hundred feet into the cave, the terrible stench of rotting flesh starts to grow.
                When the party starts to see light up ahead, Kag hears a crooked voice in his head expressing its
                excitement for new play-things, then Merle spots a creature scitter across the wall and over a ledge
                30ft above them. Kag and Hazard start to climb the wall of the crevasse to investigate only to encounter
                a hideous, black, one-eyed creature with spikes protruding from his back. The creature lunges at Hazard,
                stabbing his gauntlets, causing him to lose his grasp and fall back down the crevasse. Hazard recognizes
                the creature as a Nothic. Upon reaching the top of the ledge, Kag turns to see the creature and,
                realizing he is now alone, quickly starts descending the crevasse.
                <br>
                <br>
                Denethor summons a wolf which wall-jumps his way up the crevasse and engages the Nothic. While its
                distracted, Hazard uses the creatures telepathy against it, taunting it to come down and fight. After
                slaying the magic wolf, the Nothic obliges them, jumping down directly in front of Hazard. After
                receiving a few blows, it casts its gaze at Hazard, who suffers an agonizing sensation of his flesh
                rotting off before falling unconscious. Seeing this, Kag goes into a wild rage, jumping from the cliff
                and thrusting his battleaxe into the back of the Nothic, who lets out a final, loud screech before
                dying.
                <br>
                <br>
                When the echo of the screech begins to fade, the party hears footsteps growing increasingly louder in
                the large cavern over head.
            </p>
            <h4 id='session4'>Session 4: March 19th, 2019</h4>
            <p>
                The party awakens from a well-deserved rest each feeling strangely revitalized and alert. Sildar informs
                the group that he found a letter on Klarg's desk. It reads:
                Klarg,
                If ever there was a moment that I needed you to not be the dawdling idiot I know you to be, it is now.
                Our “benefactor” has informed me that a dwarf by the name of Gundren Rockseeker will be traveling South
                along the Triboar Trail towards Phandelin sometime in the next few weeks. You are to capture him ALIVE
                and bring him to the Castle for questioning. Anything else you plunder is ours.
                - King Grol
                <br>
                <br>
                The party decides to continue their mission to Phandelin. Along the road, Sildar gives the adventurers a
                brief history of Phandelin, explaining it was once a great city before the Great Scourge spread across
                Faerun, destroying everything in its path. Now the city is in a state of rebirth, largely fueled by
                prospectors and miners seeking to reclaim the land's resources.
                <br>
                <br>
                As the party draws near, they see wooden and crude stone buildings built in the midst of a large expanse
                of marble ruins overgrown with ivy. They find their way to Barthen's Provisions to unload their cargo.
                Barthen greets them warmly and pays out their dues as per their contracts. While the party chats with
                the shopkeeper about the town, Hazard steps outside to inspect a small stone chapel next door. He
                recognizes its dedicated to Tymora, the goddess of good luck and fortune.
                <br>
                <br>
                Sildar informs them he is going to try and find a member of the Lords' Alliance that resides in the town
                to ask him for advice. He says he'll be staying at the Stonehill Inn if they need him. Octavius heads to
                meet the Elmar, the blacksmith, who works from his shop in the Lionshield Coster. Octavius recognizes
                the symbol on the sign above the door as the same found on the crates back in the Cragmaw cave hideout.
                Octavius haggles with Elmar, over armor prices before trading in his warpick for a shiny new battleaxe.
                <br>
                <br>
                The rest of the party follows their ears to a rowdy tavern called The Sleeping Giant. They order a round
                from the dwarven barkeep, Grista, and question her about the ruffians in the corner. She informs them
                that they're Redbrands, and not to be messed with. Kag decides to try his hand and darts and accepts a
                wager from a local hustler. With a little magical assistance from Merle, Kag defeats the hustler at his
                game and uses his earnings to buy the next round.
                <br>
                <br>
                Growing impatient and upset by the glares he's receiving from the Redbrands, Denethor goes directly to
                the bar, purchases two tankards of ale, and promptly tosses them into the faces of the ruffians. Hazard
                draws his maul to defend his ally, starting a gruesome bar fight. Kag joins the fray with a flying
                missile drop kick which sends a Redbrand crashing into wall behind him. Merle fires some wild shots
                which ricochet comically about the room. Hazard summons a lightning bolt which crashes through the roof,
                smiting a ruffian in the process. All the while, the patrons of the bar cower in the corner.
                <br>
                <br>
                Octavius strolls out of the shop and sees a large crowd gathered outside a building across the town
                square and goes to investigate. As he pushes his way through the crowd, he sees a sinister group of
                thugs jogging towards the action from a distance. Octavius enters the tavern to find it in a state of
                utter dismay. A ray of sunlight passes through a hole in the ceiling and falls on a 4 dead bodies on the
                floor. Above the bodies stand his companions, breathing heavily and covered in blood.</p>

            <h4 id='session3'>Session 3: March 12th, 2019</h4>
            <p>
                After a brief respite, the party continues their exploration of the cave. Following a dark passageway,
                the party is led to the western end of a familiar wooden bridge. The party then takes turns poking
                their heads out from under cover to inspect the area. Whether by misfortune or foolishness, Merle is
                spotted by the Goblin patrolling the bridge and catches a well-placed arrow in the scruff of his neck.
                The Goblin then calls out to his brethren standing guard below who ready for battle. Merle uses this
                moment to enact his revenge, hitting the Goblin with a crossbow bolt, causing him to fall to his death.
                Not wishing to suffer the same fate as their canine companion, the party cautiously crosses the bridge,
                setting up defenses at the top of a sloping passage leading down to the pools.
                <br>
                <br>
                The party evades a round of arrow volleys before Denethor rushes ahead into battle. He swiftly makes
                his way to the pools and opens the flood gate, but is unable catch any of the Goblins in their trap.
                Next in is Sildar, who arrives just in time to shield 2 arrows from striking his wood-elf friend.
                Unfortunately, a third arrow strikes Sildar's leg, incapacitating him. The rest of the party then joins
                the fray and dispatches the remaining Goblins.
                <br>
                <br>
                From a well-lit cavern to the southeast of the pools, the party hears a low, booming voice yell out
                "Have you not taken care of the intruders yet?!" Denethor sneak up to investigate the source and sees a
                tall, imposing figure covered in fur wielding a great club in one hand and a chain leash tied to a wolf
                in the other. The hirsute figure announces himself as Lord Klarg and threatens to turn the adventurers
                into delicious jelly if they dare oppose him. They opt to do so.
                <br>
                <br>
                Kag leads the charge, taking cover behind an upturned dining table only to quickly discover that 2
                Goblins had the same idea. They exchange blows, but Kag gets the upper hand, mortally wounding one.
                Hazard blasts the room with a thunderwave, harming Klarg and flinging a Goblin across the room.
                Octavius performs a heroic leap over the fire pit and is quickly engaged by Klarg's ferocious pet wolf,
                Ruffles. Denethor lets off a magnificent shot from his longbow that takes an unbelievable trajectory,
                first striking Klarg through the throat, ricocheting off the wall and landing in the base of the
                bugbear's skull. His lifeless body falls into the fire pit releasing a malodorous cloud of smoke.
                Octavius fends off the beasts attacks with his forearm while driving his warpick through its skull.
                <br>
                <br>
                After the battle, Hazard discovers in Klarg's desk a sack of gold teeth and two potions of healing,
                which he deftly snatches using the timeless "I saw it first" strategy of plundering. Merle and Octavius
                meanwhile return to their regular routine of feet-burning torture in order to extract information from
                the one surviving Goblin. Kag reluctantly takes up his role again as interpreter. He learns that the
                Goblins were instructed to take a particular dwarf prisoner back to their base (Cragmaw Castle) for
                questioning. Sildar informs the group that the Cragmaws are a band of thieves and thugs and that
                they're certainly not prosperous nor have the wherewithal to construct a castle. More investigation is
                required...
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4 id='session2'>Session 2: March 5th, 2019</h4>
            <p>The party awakes the following morning to find Sildar sitting in self-reflection, tending a campfire
                which he
                uses to brew his morning coffee. The moment's peace is broken when the group takes up their debate from
                the
                previous night over where to head next. They eventually settle on pursuing the Goblins and helping
                Sildar
                investogate his missing friend.
                <br>
                <br>Upon arriving at the location of the previous nights encounter, Sildar performs the last rights on
                his
                fallen comrade while Denethor and Kag scout the woods for Goblin tracks. They find footprints leading
                to a worn
                path that leads uphill through the woods. The path comes to a clearing in the woods near the base of a
                cliff.
                They spot a cave opening in the cliff side from which a stream flows in their general direction.
                Attempt to get
                a closer inspection, Denethor alerts some Goblin lookouts hiding in the nearby woods. A battle ensues.
                <br>
                <br>Merle fires blindly into the woods and lands some lucky shots with his crossbow while the others
                charge
                into the woods, weapons drawn. They make quick work of the scouts, stopping one from escaping and
                alerting his
                friends.
                <br>
                <br>After the skirmish, the party sneaks into the cave and encounters a pack of wild dogs chained to a
                post
                driven in the floor. Hazard tosses a portion of his private stash of horse meat to the beasts, which
                seems to
                keep them appeased for the time being.
                <br>
                <br>Following the stream deeper into the cave, the party spots another Goblin lookout standing atop a
                bridge
                over the stream. In an attempt to flank the Goblin, Kag and Denethor try to climb up a pile of rubble
                near the
                bridge while Merle distracts the guard by conjuring an illusory floating sack of gold. The plan is
                unsuccessful. The goblin is alerted and calls out behind him, "Release the flood!"
                <br>
                <br> A moment passes before a huge wave of water rushes through the cave, sweeping Merle, Octavius and
                Hazard
                off their feet and out of the cave. Kag and Denethor climb to the top of the rubble and drop a rope
                down for
                their friends, who now must run back to their previous location while dodging Goblin arrows. Once
                everyone is
                safe atop the rubble pile, they hearing hideous laughing from a passage above them. They climb up to
                investigate and find 5 Goblins torturing a young dwarf. Sildar strikes first with his throwing knife,
                then
                chaos commences.
                <br>
                <br>After a bloody skirmish with the Goblins, Sildar approaches the badly beaten dwarf. They discover
                the dwarf
                is not Sildar's friend (who turns out to be Gundren Rockseeker, the party's employer), but a simple
                merchant
                captured on his way to Phandelin. When questioned, the dwarf reveals that he is not the only dwarf that
                has
                been held captive here, though he does not know any names, nor where they are located. He claims there
                are more
                Goblins on the Eastern portion of the cave.
                <br>
                <br>The party decides to rest and nurse their wounds before continuing onward.</p>

            <p>Answering a flyer posted on a job board in Neverwinter, you meet a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker. He
                offers you 10gp to transport a wagon of supplies to Barthen's Provisions the nearby settlement of
                Phandalin. Gundren says he would normally do the job himself, but he has "an important family
                obligation that he must attend to immediately."
                <br>
                <br>The first two days of your journey are uneventful. You pass the time sharing stories with the other
                members of the crew hired for the job. They include:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>a wood elf druid named Denethor</li>
                    <li>a half-orc barbarian named Kag</li>
                    <li>a half-elf paladin named Octavius</li>
                    <li>a human cleric named Hazard</li>
                    <li>and a talking wolf warlock named Merle</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>As your party undertook the most dangerous stretch of the journey, the Triboar Trail, they spotted
                an overturned cart and two dead horses. Upon investigating, they were ambushed by a pack of Goblins.
                Who are dispatched in a most gruesome manner
                <br>
                <br>That night, Denethor keeps watch while the party rests. He hears yelling down the road and wakes
                Octavius and Merle to investigate. They find Sildar Hallwinter fending off a pack of Goblins and rush
                to his aid. The party captures a Goblin alive and takes him back to camp for questioning.
                <br>
                <br>Acting as an interpreter, Kag reveals that the Goblins were instructed to capture any dwarves they
                encounter on their regular raids of the trail and bring them to their hideout. Sildar seems dismayed at
                hearing this news. Upon questioning him, Sildar explains that he is looking for his friend, a dwarf,
                that has gone missing. Sildar resolves that he will head to the Goblin hideout at daybreak to
                investigate. After some heated discussion among the group, you decide the assist Sildar on his quest.
